Notes:

<sup>1</sup> - Only years since 2011 are depicted, but some sources, like EPA CEMS, are available many years back.
 For LCI sources, which can be constructed from multiple dates, the target year is used.

 <sup>2</sup> - The amount of Canadian imports is available for the years specified
 but the fraction of each type of generator in the Canadian regions is based on
 2016 only.

 <sup>3</sup> - The inventories for these technologies are based on data from the year
 2016. For example, the inventory for wind farm x is calculated using the turbines
 that existed in 2016. However, so long as the same plants exist in other years
 in the EIA 923 data, that inventory can be re-used and applied to different years.
