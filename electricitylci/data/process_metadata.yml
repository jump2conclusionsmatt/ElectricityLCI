    Flow-level data quality scores
    are assigned to each elementary flow exchange and process-level scores to each

    generation processes, for each emission factor, five data quality scores were
    assigned on flow-level data quality scoring. Process data quality scores draw
    on the process US EPA  DQ indicator guidance. Process completeness is
    calculated by first creating a list of expected flows for each fuel type. U.S.
    average profiles for the fuels used in electricity generation are developed for
    expected flows in the following categories: greenhouse gases (GHG), CAPs, toxic
    and hazardous air pollutants (HAP), toxic water discharges, toxic soil
    releases, and hazardous waste. To determine the expected flows in each category
    the number of flows reported in the underlying data sources NEI, TRI, eGRID,
    RCRAInfo are summed across eGRID subregions by fuel type. Expected flows by
    fuel type for other inputs and outputs including intermediate inputs, raw
    energy demands, and water inputs are determined based on flows reported for the
    relevant electricity generation fuel type in existing LCI datasets such as
    ANL’s GREET model, NREL’s USLCI, and ecoinvent. Expected nutrient discharges to
    water are derived from a sample of electric facilities reporting to USEPA’s
    Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR). The actual flows evaluated for each fuel
    type by eGRID subregion can then be documented and compared to the U.S. average
    electrical fuel generation profiles to determine the overall process
    completeness according to the method described in USEPA LCA Data Quality
    Assessment guidance. Air emission flow data collection scores can also draw on
    these fuel-specific profiles by documenting whether an expected flow is being
    reported by the fuel type in the relevant eGRID subregion. An expected emission
    may not be captured if there are discrepancies between the facilities covered
    in eGRID and those reporting to the USEPA databases TRI, NEI, RCRAInfo.'
